VALUE=90

;HINT_x multiply the radius of the corner seen by the AI. Useful when AI is too fast or too slow in a corner.. usually due to compression/decompressions but there could be other reasons such as hairpin with long straight after and where the AI is going in too hot loosing in exit speed.
;BRAKEHINT_x changes the AI idea of how hard it can brake in that zone.. again some compression and,especially decompression area might need this
;DANGER_x is an hint that kicks in when the AI is engaged and it's informing the AI to take it easy in that section if engaged.. it's used very rarely
